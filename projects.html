    <p>For my <strong>first web project</strong>, I didn't do development at all, but <strong>SEO</strong> for Sharpline Stategies, LLC. Sharpline had been in business for a while, but wasn't seeing the traffic it wanted. I set them up with <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, wrote code that would get them recoginized, and watched the site hits grow.</p>
    <p>After only a few weeks, Sharpline's traffic had <strong>tripled</strong>! The experience taught me how to write code effectively so that search engines and customers can easily find websites - an invaluable lesson.</p>

    <p>David Saunders is an accomplished PGA pro and instructor. He's also a close friend of mine. He came to me for help with his current website that was beginning to become so outdated that he hesitated to advertise it. He wanted a <strong>fresher look</strong> and <strong>better functionality</strong>. </p>
    <p>I did a bit of redesign, moved the code into the <strong>Bootstrap</strong> world, and fixed some bugs that were causing problems.</p>
    <p>Now David has a website he's proud to share, and so am I!</p>
